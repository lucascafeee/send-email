# send-email
A Golang-based project that provides a service aimed at allowing batch email sending, i.e., automated and in large quantities, thus making the process easier for the customer who does not have to worry about sending each email individually. This can be particularly useful in cases where it is necessary to send emails to a large number of recipients, such as marketing campaigns or mass customer communication.
